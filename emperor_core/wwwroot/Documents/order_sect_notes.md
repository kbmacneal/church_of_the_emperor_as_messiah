### Karmists - Believe in a cycle of rebirth which ends in your soul merging with the Emperox's

- Very similar to the Hindu/Buddhist interpretation of [Dharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma)/[Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma) (where they got the name)
- **How do the Karmists view the Emperox**: The Emperox is a Divine Soul, much like a Buddha. They possess cosmic wisdom that they pass on to humanity through their words and deeds. The new chosen Emperor is automatically assumed to the next incarnation of a Divine Soul. This would imply that the Karmists have a great deal to do after the Emperox is chosen, and it would imply that, to the Karmists, the selection of the Emperox by the Council of Houses is a kind of holy act. Each Emperox, after they die, is examined and determined to be the incarnation of the Arhat of (Virtue) and is given a Holy Name by the karmist, and their geneology is examined to perhaps find the next Incarnation.
- **What is the Karmists view of the role of the Church**: The main goal of the church in this case is to preserve the lineage of Imperial manifestation, to learn the divine truth the Emperox wishes to convey, package it up and deliver it to the masses so that they too may be closer to enlightenment.
- **How do the Purists view**:
    - **Nobility** If they are wealthy/powerful enough, they must be the incarnations of lesser Great Souls. Nobility are the cream rising to the top, those closest to achieving Karmic balance.
    - **Serfdom** They must have done something wrong in a previous life in order to be so lowly born, their primary aim should be to better adhere to the virtues so that they may one day be born a noble.
- **Arhats of the Karmists**: There are probably quite a few. Outside of the standard Arhats of the various Virtues, the Karmists probably have recorded a great many instances where the Divine Souls have manifested themselves throughout Imperial history. They have a genealogical record that meshes with the history of the Empire, "so and so born on this date of house XXXX was the Arhat of Financial wisdom because they did YYYY".
- **Special ceremonies/rituals**: There is a special ceremony held at the first transit of Shiva across Sig called the Fesitval of the Emperox. There's another festival held at the last transit of the Imperial calendar called the Festival of Lights. This is a throwback to the old earth holiday celebrated on the Indian subcontinent, and is a time of renewal before the Emperox, a rejuvinatory time where people celebrate the past year and look forward to the next.
- **Administrative duties**: The karmists don't really hold that much direct administrative control, but their main function is to preserve the official church geneologies so they can spot potential manifestations of the Divine Soul throughout history.

### Observers - Watchers and guides who try to interfere as little as possible

- **How does the order view the Emperox?**
- **How does the order view the Church’s role?**
- **What is the order’s view on the nobility? Serfdom?**
- **Are there any special Arhats that we should canonize?**
- **Are there any special rituals, events, or celebrations that define your order?**
- **How is the order incorporated into Church Administration?**

### Purists - Concerned with the purity of humanity in the face of aliens, synths and other threats

- The central idea is a sort of [Nietzschean Übermensch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch).
- **How the purists view the Emperox**:  The Emperox is the supreme ideal. Their example is the example we should all follow, flaws/vices/shortcomings included. They are not terribly concerned with whether the Emperox is divine in the traditional sense, but rather with the idea that the Emperox is divine while they are still alive.
- **What do the purists consider to be the role of the Church**: Maintaining the purity of humanity, not genetically but spiritually, “fanning the flames of the human spirit” kinda deal.
- **How do the purists view**
    - **Nobility**: The guardians of humanity, or the worst expression of humanities vices, take your pick. Being a bad example is still useful as a lesson in what not to do.
    - **Serfs**: They have the capacity to become divine through careful application of the virtues, but they have to work harder since they're, you know, poor.
- **Arhats of the purists**: Probably few, some may revere the Blood Eagle. Others may revere serpens precog arhats as having access to divine knowledge. MES is either a gift from the Divine Emperox, giving special powers to deserving nobles, or its some kind of alien experiment on the human genome, and no one's really sure which one is correct. As long as they use their powers wisely and for the betterment of the Empire, no problem.
- **Special events/rituals**: Definitely the Crucible. After some pretty intense training, the inquisition dumps you on Satira Pala with a small bone knife, gives you a day’s head start, and hunts you for two days in the freezing cold. The idea is A) that you have to survive on your own, with no support, encouraging a spirit of self-reliance which is useful on alien worlds with no backup and B) That you can empathize with the people you track, you know the fear and the terrible feeling of being hunted, so that the Inquisitor, when they are tracking someone, can show restraint.
- **Church administrative duties**: Incorporated into the Crux-esque law enforcement. Lots of paperwork, tracking people of interest, finding them, bringing them back to Andophael for judgement. Tracking down rogue Excommunicates. Investigating synth incursions into Church structure.
