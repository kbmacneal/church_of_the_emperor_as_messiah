# Part 1: Branches

In which the Gang writes more about the orders that we named but didn’t really pay attention to.

## Questions to answer

- How does the order view the Emperor?

- How does the order view the Church’s role?

- What is the order’s view on the nobility? Serfdom?

- Are there any special Arhats that we should canonize?

- Are there any special rituals, events, or celebrations that define your order?

- How is the order incorporated into Church Administration?

### High Order - Bureaucracy and central administration of the High Church

### Guardians - Protectors of humanity and the faith

### Crusaders - Military branch and fleet

### Orthodoxy - Followers of the Scripture as written

### Masoodites - Believe that the first High Exarch is the true Prophet

### Conservatives - Followers of old dogma with ever new interpretations

### Reformists - Take a practical view on Doctrine and Faith

### Karmists - Believe in a cycle of rebirth which ends in your soul merging with the Emperor's

### Observers - Watchers and guides who try to interfere as little as possible

### Purists - Concerned with the purity of humanity in the face of aliens, synths and other threats

- The central idea is a sort of [Nietzschean Übermensch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch).

- **How the purists view the Emperor**:  The Emperox is the supreme ideal. Their example is the example we should all follow, flaws/vices/shortcomings included. They are not terribly concerned with whether the Emperox is divine in the traditional sense, but rather with the idea that the Emperox is divine while they are still alive.

- **What do the purists consider to be the role of the Church**: Maintaining the purity of humanity, not genetically but spiritually, “fanning the flames of the human spirit” kinda deal.

- **How do the purists view**

    - **Nobility**: The guardians of humanity, or the worst expression of humanities vices, take your pick. Being a bad example is still useful as a lesson in what not to do.

    - **Serfs**: They have the capacity to become divine through careful application of the virtues, but they have to work harder since they're, you know, poor.

- **Arhats of the purists**: Probably few, some may revere the Blood Eagle. Others may revere serpens precog arhats as having access to divine knowledge. MES to a purist is a gift from the Divine Emperor, giving special powers to deserving nobles.

- **Special events/rituals**: Definitely the Crucible. After some pretty intense training, the inquisition dumps you on Satira Pala with a small bone knife, gives you a day’s head start, and hunts you for two days in the freezing cold. The idea is A) that you have to survive on your own, with no support, encouraging a spirit of self-reliance which is useful on alien worlds with no backup and B) That you can empathize with the people you track, you know the fear and the terrible feeling of being hunted, so that the Inquisitor, when they are tracking someone, can show restraint.

- **Church administrative duties**: Incorporated into the Crux-esque law enforcement. Lots of paperwork, tracking people of interest, finding them, bringing them back to Andophael for judgement. Tracking down rogue Excommunicates. Investigating synth incursions into Church structure.
