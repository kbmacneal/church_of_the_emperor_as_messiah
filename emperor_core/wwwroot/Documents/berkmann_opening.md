# Praise Be to the Emperox

## A New Cathedral Opens on Berkmann

The friends of the Church, the Trilliant Ring, have been hard at work constructing a new Temple to the Emperox on Berkmann III. We are pleased to announce that their work is complete! Ten Blessings to all at Trilliant for their hard work and faith! The new cathedral will shine like a beacon, bringing the Ten Virtues to the farthest reaches of Acheron Rho!
