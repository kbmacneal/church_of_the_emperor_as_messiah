# Burial Practices of High Church of the Emperox-as-Messiah in Conjunction with House Lyra

For as long as history dates in Acheron Rho, the High Church and House Lyra have worked together closely, The High Church guiding the Soul through life while House Lyra prepares the Soul for Death. When a member of the honoured clergy dies they are laid to rest in a way befitting someone who had followed the Ten Virtues.They are tended to by a cache of Neshmet who are trained specially to follow the rites and rituals of the High Church. First they are given the final funeral rites of House Lyra to ensure their transition to the After, a creation of God. Afterwards during the ceremony, members of the clergy will perform the Statement of Virtue. This ceremony entails the wrapping of the corpse by members of the Church, in colours befitting each virtue.
