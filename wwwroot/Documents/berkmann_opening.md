# Praise Be to the Emperox

## A New Cathedral Opens on Berkmann

The High Church is pleased to announce that the new Cathedral to the Emperox is open on the planet Berkmann III, due to the hard work of our friends in the Trilliant Ring. Featuring nine separate areas for contemplation and worship, the new Cathedral is truely a testament to the glory of the Empire.

Ten Blessings to all at Trilliant for their hard work and faith, and to those who completed the project under budget and ahead of schedule! The new Cathedral will shine like a beacon, bringing the Ten Virtues to the farthest reaches of Acheron Rho!
