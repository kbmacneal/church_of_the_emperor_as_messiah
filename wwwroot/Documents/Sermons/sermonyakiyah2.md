_The High Priest and the Inquisitor emerge onto the stage from the private clergy chambers_

## High Inquisitor Purist Pelax

_Slow, chanting music fills the chamber._

_The two priests, one in white and gold, the other in black and silver walk to the middle of the stage._

_Their backs to the pews, they bow before the large, oil painting of the insignia of the High Order of the Church, framed in black._

_The music quiets. From the corner of the altar, the priest in black takes a small bucket and brush._

_He unstoppers a bottle of what appears to be vodka, and mixes it with another bottle of water in the small bucket._

_The two priests start to walk clockwise around the room. Approaching the first pillar,  they begin._

"House Crux", _the priest says, chanting the recitation for the virtue of faith, sprinkling the pungent liquid over the base of the statue._

_Moving to the second pillar, he sprinkles more libation_ "House Aquila".

_He proceeds around the room, list all ten houses, major and minor, sprinkling libation and chanting the recitations of all ten virtues._

_The priest in white motions for all to stand for the first hymn._

## High Priest Callixtus Pius 
Welcome, Children of the Empire. My name is High Priest Callixtus. I see many faces in the audience familiar and new. As you may be aware this event is a refresher of sorts. We will review the Ten Virtues and what they mean in your life.

As is tradition, we shall begin this Sermon with song. If you do not have a songbook, that is fine. The Lyrics shall be displayed on the screen for you to follow.

_sings along from memory_

## High Priest Callixtus Pius

What a wonderful rendition!  It always pleases my heart to hear our sacred songs filling a church hall. It gives me goosebumps.

Now. To the discussion on things above.

God is almighty. They created all things. Their favoured creation was Humanity and they blessed us all with an eternal Soul.  In Order to Communicate with Humanity God sent forth Messiahs. Ancient ones who left us the Sacred Texts which we study to this day, but also A living embodiment of God's will. The Messiah, The Emperor.

From our Messiah, we have received the most important knowledge of all. How can I please God?

God, through his Messiah, gave us a way to live our life. A way to direct ourselves in service to his will.

These are The Ten Virtues.

The First Virtue is Faith. It is above all the other Virtues. Faith in God, Faith in the Emperor and Faith in the High Church. Your faith in God should lead you to sacrifice. Sacrifice of the Body, in your wealth. Sacrifice of the Mind, in your Time. Those of you who wish to earn a blessing from God should seek to make Pilgrimage to Andophal, the Holy Planet of the High Exarch.

I now invite you all to meditate on faith. Meditate on what you can do in service to God. You have made a step today by being here, for this Sermon.

A bell tolls, indicating a time for contemplation has begun. These are traditionally 15m in length.

## S. Harvey, Director of A.C.R.E.

_closes my eyes and puts my head down.  Appearing to focus._

_big ol' alien titties keep popping into my head_

## High Inquisitor Purist Pelax 
_The Acolyte Crestus scampers to the control panel. The lights dim slightly. A slight hum starts as a holoscreen is projected in front of the altar._

_Images of a family are projected into the center of the room. Two lovers walking underneath 5 moons. A mother teaching her son to read. A farmer plowing his field. A tax collector doing his books. A soldier drilling on a sun-scorched parade ground._

The Second Virtue is Propriety. An Adherence to Tradition. Respecting the station which you are born into, respecting the order in which God places us. To please God you must respect your local authority as well as the authority of God.

_A few moments of silence_

_The projection changes. A judge handing down a verdict. A Soldier leaping through a crumbling wall. A Farmer helping an injured man to his feet._

The Third Virtue is Justice. This is the system by which those who choose to follow the will of God are either rewarded or punished. This Virtue is evidently clear in our Faithful Noble House Crux. It also represents an Inward reflection. As the sacred text states "Who amongst you can remove a twig from your brothers eye, before removing the branch from your own."

_More silence_

_The projection shifts one final time. A synth killing a teenage boy. A man in pain, writing as doctors scramble around him. A Farmer, staring at a blighted field, his withered children looking up at him._

The Fourth Virtue is Fortitude. Dearest members of my congregation. You must have fortitude in these difficult times! This is a Virtue of Endurance, or progressing through hard times without complaint. Do not despair when times are tough, for by enduring them happily you please God and shall be rewarded.

_Two bells toll, a sign for more contemplation, as before_

## High Priest Callixtus Pius
Children. The questions these virtues can raise within us are often not easy. Should you wish to unburden yourselves from your troubles, our clergy will be available to you in the Confessional during this period of reflection.

## S. Harvey, Director of A.C.R.E.
_Mentally struggling with the second virtue._

_Remembering the farm I was born and raised on before I worked my way up to being a director_

_stand up, heading to the first confessional_

## High Priest Callixtus Pius 

_the stage is currently empty, aside from the usual furniture_

## High Inquisitor Purist Pelax 

_Soft music plays in the background, about being champions_

## High Inquisitor Purist Pelax 

_The music slowly dies as the congregation returns to their seats_

## S. Harvey, Director of A.C.R.E. 

_walks back to my seat, head hung low_

## High Priest Callixtus Pius 

The next Virtue is one that comes after meditation

A Virtue that comes after growth, and after learning.

It is the Fifth Virtue, Wisdom.

Wisdom is hard to grasp if you have not first understood the endurance of Fortitude, the peace of Justice and the knowledge of Propriety

DO NOT BE MISLED.

_A booming shout, awakens those drowsy in the pews_

Do not just accept what you believe the world to be. See it as it actually is.

_A graphic appears on the screen, it lists the first five virtues on the left. In the centre there is a mirror, and on the right the last five._

Our Virtues Mirror one another. By studying the first we study the last and by studying the last we study the first.

The Sixth Virtue is Temperance, The Mirror of Wisdom.

Temperance speaks to your wise decisions to be moderate in habits, not indulging in any vice to excess. We should have no desire stronger than the desire to serve God.

We shall now have the second hymn, as we have reached the midpoint in our discussion of the Virtues.

Please those who are able join me in a rendition of a sad story. A poor boy who needed to find his way back to God. Very much like all of us, striving after the Virtues.

_Comes up down the aisle and tries to be as visibly uncomfortable as she can without it being too obvious and sits_

## High Inquisitor Purist Pelax 

The Seventh Virtue: Diligence, the mirror of Fortitue. Endurance of hard times.

Diligence speaks to not losing focus when you have much and life is easy. Even while your burdens are reduced and you do not have to struggle so hard to feel the blessings of God, it is important you fully complete your service to God. Diligently perform all sacrifices, and attend all services and festivals even if you feel you do not currently need guidance.

The Eighth Virtue is Charity, A mirror of Justice. While Justice often falls heavy upon those who are without faith Charity is the reward who those who have faith. Although adherents to the faith must find contentment in their station and not reach higher, they also should not be forced lower than their station. The Church will provide an equalising to those who are being mistreated by those in stations above them.

_Three bells toll, urging people to their seats_

_Soft music plays, as the Exarch approaches the altar_

## Exarch Purist Batukhan Alexander 

Hello Everyone, i will be taking over for this part of the Sermon

I can speak to Integrity, The Ninth Virtue and mirror to Propriety. Integrity to one's self is one of the greatest sources of healing for one's 
soul.

we must not Lie, Lying is to Damage one's soul with a false hood that can Hurt worse than any blade. Truth is the only Thing that can heal that 
injury.

The Confessions are symbol of Integrity, The Embodiment of that Very Virtue. to Talk with someone and have them help you Guide yourself to a truth 
that has been Plaguing  you.

Tragedy, Loss, Anger, Guilt. all of these things are symptoms or a truth That often we are not ready to face yet and the Confessionals try to Help 
you.

Alas, I Ramble on, and should Return the Reins of this to one of the priests here

_The Exarch makes his way off stage_

## High Priest Callixtus Pius 

Thank you, Exarch, for your wise words. It is not often we are graced with the presence of one so faithful as him. Please talk with him further for
 some facinating insights. And now, to the Tenth Virtue. It is last, but important. It is the Mirror of Faith. Through Faith, we find Hope. To bring back some hope to you in these troubled times you are invited to partake in some light refreshments, and the finest wine our monasteries here on Yakiyah can produce.

_Music plays, Acolytes and servants appear. Trays of delicacies and barrels of wine are available in the grand hall and wine tasting room_

Eat, Drink and be Merry

Ten Blessings upon all of you for listening today.

## High Inquisitor Purist Pelax 

Glory to the Empire!

_A Soft music starts to play, and acolytes begin cleaning around the stage area outwards to the exit. They are softly shuffling people to the door in a cordon of cleaning_
