The door to the priest's waiting room slowly opens. Pelax, with his dark robes, walks in, closing the door behind him. He takes his gloves off, puts them on the small table by the door, and rests his cane next to them.

Looking around the empty room, he slowly slips into his ceremonial vestments, which had been stored in the large wardrobe in one corner of the room. The vestments are jet black, with large, intricately-embroidered motifs along the back and sides depicting the glories of the Empire in silver thread. Picking up his gloves and cane, he stows them into the back of the wardrobe. After all, they cost him a small fortune to acquire.

Callixtus, holding a bottle of what appears to be very expensive brandy, opens a side door, liquor slopping out the neck of the bottle as he sets it down on another small table.

"Callixtus," Pelax mutters with a small nod.

"Inquisitor", Callixtus replies, shuffling over to the wardrobe on the opposite corner. Opening the door, he begins to put on his vestments: white with gold inlay decorated with various symbols and iconography of the Church spread across his breast and shoulders. An ornate gold belt holds the robe in place, the Imperial Crest as a Buckle. 

The men sit in silence, the occasional burp punctuating the deep quiet of the room as Callixtus finishes his brandy. No doubt the bottle also cost a small fortune, the Trilliant Ring logo flickering holographically in a variety of colours.

Pelax breaks the awkward silence. "My dear Callixtus, what brings you so far from Imperial Prime? It  has been quite some time since Andophael was graced with your, particular, brand of worship," he says, gesturing to the now nearly empty bottle of high-grade liquor.

"The people of Hong Lu were kind enough to host me at a banquet. The Council sent me to investigate their 'charity work' but there was nothing to be found. Directors of A.C.R.E were also in attendance. They expressed concern about the faith of their people. I decided it was in the best interest of the High Church to put those concerns to rest."  The normally jubilant man sighed. "It is troubling times we live in, Pelax. I fear your skills will be in great demand." 

"My skills, and those of the Inquisition, have always been in great demand, my dear Callixtus. It is only now that the Voice realises as much, and is willing to do something about it," Pelax says in a hushed tone.

A soft knock at the door, and Batukhan Alexander, Exarch of the Purists, enters the now mildly crowded room. Callixtus snaps from a slouch to attention, hiding the bottle of Trilliant Brandy behind his back. Pelax stands and bows to the head of his order. "Exarch," he says, "We had not received word that you would be arriving. What brings you from Andophael?"

"The Council thought it best a higher level representative of the Church be here," said Batukhan, attaching the stole to the back of his vestments and shrugging them into position. The cream on white gives a hypnotic effect as he moves back to the cupboard to stash his personal effects. "With the current state of the sector, there are certain things that the Grand Voice and other Exarchs want taken special care of. Besides, Tatiana never likes missing opportunities for good publicity. She is even considering a full interview with PRISM, though I doubt the others would consent. She has a tendency of putting herself in ill favor with other diplomats." Finishing belting his robes, he takes a seat near Callixtus, grabbing a glass for himself and pulling out from his sleeve a flask before filling his glass with the contents. "Not to mention the most recent bout of diplomacy we engaged in ended with a member of the church of humanity repentant daring myself, the Grand Voice and an inquisitor to kill him in an audience chamber if we deemed him a threat. Good publicity is something that would assuage any concerns of the council and the Grand Voice." 

A small bell rings in the antechamber's speakers. Slow, chanting hymns slowly began to fill the room outside, a muffled creak echoing through the hall as the large steel main doors open, allowing the worshippers to take their seats for the service. Pelax, rising slowly, motions for Callixtus to join him. "Nothing too heretical, if you please Callixtus. I despise the paperwork."

Standing in the doorway, Callixtus cast a baleful glance at Pelax. "I merely say what is in the sacred texts, who am I to soften their impact?" he chortles. "In any case, I doubt many in this particular audience will be listening."

Callixtus grabs Pelax's arms as he makes to go through the side door to the main church chamber, and motions the Exarch closer. "There's a reporter here from PRISM. Morton. He was on Hong Lu with me. He intends to write an expose, so we should be very careful in our words," he whispers, glancing at the door.

"If the Network cared about such things they would have published things far more scandalous than a sermon long ago", Pelax says dryly. "With the political and religious upheaval of late, there is more than enough fodder for the tabloids for the minor heresies of two priests to make any kind of headway. Besides, the Corporatists care about profit, regardless of the truth or meaning of what we preach about here today. When the time comes, I pray the Church can right that particular Imperial shortcoming, but for now there isn't anything to worry about." Callixtus gives a small nod.

"I invited the reporter to share a drink with us here afterwards. You can keep me in check as much as you like then. I know some do not share such a liberal view of reinterpreting the older scripture as myself. I'll keep the theories and context to a minimum this time." 

"Drinking? With you, Callixtus?" Pelax chuckles. "I will see if we can get a biomedical transport on standby. This reporter may need to have their organs replaced before the night is done."

Two bells ring through the speakers. "Showtime," Pelax mutters, and the three men enter the hall.
