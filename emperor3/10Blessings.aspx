                <h2>The First Virtue is Faith.</h2>
                <blockquote>Recitation: “Faith above all. We must trust God and their chosen Emperor to guide us.” Faith is exemplified by daily prayer, regular attendance of Church ceremonies, dutiful tithing, and pilgrimage to holy sites.</blockquote>

            <td>
                <h2>The Second Virtue is Propriety, which flows from Faith.</h2>
                <blockquote>Recitation: “We must be obedient to tradition, ceremony, courtesy and station.” Propriety is exemplified by respectful loyalty to righteous authority and cultural norms, along with unfailing intolerance for all heretics and heathens. Custom, dress, and technology all must adhere to Propriety.</blockquote>

                <h2>The Third Virtue is Justice, which flows from Propriety.</h2>
                <blockquote>Recitation: “We must reward those who behave rightly and punish those who do not.” Justice is exemplified by its unflinching enforcement, and we must correct our own failings before looking to those of others.</blockquote>

            <td>
                <h2>The Fourth Virtue is Fortitude, which reinforces Justice.</h2>

                <h2>The Fifth Virtue is Wisdom, which accompanies Fortitude.</h2>
                <blockquote>Recitation: “We must strive to see the world in its truth and shape it according to God’s will.” Wisdom is exemplified by perceived the flawed world as it is, but never losing sight of what it should be.  Daily reflection upon the sacred texts and their application to our lives is essential to Wisdom.</blockquote>
            </td>
            <td>
                <h2>The Sixth Virtue is Temperance, which flows from Wisdom.</h2>
                <blockquote>Recitation: “We must show prudent moderation and diligent control over our desires.” Temperance is exemplified by self-restraint in all facets, particularly regular fasting and avoidance of intoxicants.</blockquote>

                <h2>The Eighth Virtue is Charity, which echoes Justice.</h2>

                <blockquote>Recitation: “We must honor our oaths and uphold the truth.” Integrity is exemplified by unfailing honesty and the exposure of deviants, as well as regular confession of our failings.</blockquote>
            </td>
            <td>
                <h2>The Tenth Virtue is Hope, which echoes Faith.</h2>
                <blockquote>Recitation: “We must never despair, no matter how dark the hour, as God shines their light upon us.”  Hope is exemplified by the conquest of despair, symbolized most prominently by the restriction of mourning to a designated period, as well as the teaching of the Virtues to the ignorant.</blockquote>
