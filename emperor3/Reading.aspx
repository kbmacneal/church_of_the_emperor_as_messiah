                            <h2>From the Book of Ages, Chapter 14, Verses 1 - 7</h2>
                            <p>1 In the first year of Emperor King Belshazʹzar of Acheron Ro, High Exarch Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream; he recorded a complete account of the matters. The Emperor declared:</p>

                            <p>2 “I was watching in my visions during the night, and look! the four winds of the heavens were stirring up the vast sea. </p>

                            <p>3 And four huge beasts came out of the sea, each different from the others.</p>

                            <p>4 “The first one was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were plucked out, and it was lifted up from the earth and was made to stand up on two feet like a man, and it was given the heart of a man. It was House Aquila, a soldier.</p>

                            <p>5 “And look! another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Get up, eat much flesh.’ It was House Crux, an enforcer.</p>

                            <p>6 “After this I kept watching, and look! another beast, like a Swan, but on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. And the beast had four heads some of which appeared as machine, and it was given authority to rule. It was House Cygnus, A magister.</p>

                            <p>7 “After this I kept watching in the visions of the night, and I saw the head of a snake, fearsome and terrifying and unusually strong, and it had large iron fangsteeth. It was devouring and crushing, and what was left it trampled down with its feet. It was different from all the other beasts that were prior to it, and it had evil in its eyes. It was House Serpens. An Assassin.</p>
