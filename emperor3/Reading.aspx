                        <p>In the fifth year of his reign, the first Emperor of the Velites, having unfit sleep, awoke with a shout, and, calling his assistants and noble court to him, did relate to them the following tale:</p>

                        <p>"In my dream I saw a ship, buttressed in gold, floating among the stars. Suddenly the skies around ripped asunder, and from the darkness came the Enemy. Wreathed in darkest fire was his head, and his eyes shone with the light of a thousand novae. Cloaked in darkness was his body. His arms were of obsidian, and his feet of coldest iron. In his hands he carried the powers of Heaven, and around his neck were the the chains of the ten vices. Lifting his great mace, he struck the ship, and it shattered, broken into ten pieces, which were thrown among the stars."</p>

                        <p>At this the assistants and nobles trembled, but the Emperor continued:</p>

                        <p>"Each of these ten parts fell flaming onto a planet, and from the wreckage rose ten cities, and from each of these ten cities rose yet more ships, and, flinging themselves into the void, they did battle with the Enemy. But one of these ships, fashioned as a snake and clad in green, turned against its brothers and clashed with them instead. So the proud ships of Humanity fell, and the darkness spread to every star and world.</p>

                        <p>But from the darkness did emerge the Emperor, clothed in light. Around his neck was the lace of the ten virtues, and on his head was the crown of dominion. In his hand was the hammer of Justice, and his feet were shod in hottest steel. The light of Virtue shone from his eyes, driving the darkness before him as the trees before a hurricane. The Emperor did battle with the Enemy, and he drove him from Acheron Rho, back into the Void, and the Void swallowed him."</p>

                            <h2>From the Book of Ages, Chapter 14, Verses 1 - 7</h2>
                            <p>1 In the first year of Emperor King Belshazʹzar of Acheron Ro, High Exarch Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head as he lay on his bed. Then he wrote down the dream; he recorded a complete account of the matters. The Emperor declared:</p>

                            <p>2 “I was watching in my visions during the night, and look! the four winds of the heavens were stirring up the vast sea. </p>

                            <p>3 And four huge beasts came out of the sea, each different from the others.</p>

                            <p>4 “The first one was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle. I watched until its wings were plucked out, and it was lifted up from the earth and was made to stand up on two feet like a man, and it was given the heart of a man. It was House Aquila, a soldier.</p>

                            <p>5 “And look! another beast, a second one, like a bear. It was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth; and it was told, ‘Get up, eat much flesh.’ It was House Crux, an enforcer.</p>

                            <p>6 “After this I kept watching, and look! another beast, like a Swan, but on its back it had four wings like those of a bird. And the beast had four heads some of which appeared as machine, and it was given authority to rule. It was House Cygnus, A magister.</p>

                            <p>7 “After this I kept watching in the visions of the night, and I saw the head of a snake, fearsome and terrifying and unusually strong, and it had large iron fangsteeth. It was devouring and crushing, and what was left it trampled down with its feet. It was different from all the other beasts that were prior to it, and it had evil in its eyes. It was House Serpens. An Assassin.</p>
