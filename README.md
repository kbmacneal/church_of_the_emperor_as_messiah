	- sudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-2.1.300-rc1-008673

	- <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>
- Clone the Repo
	- git clone https://github.com/kbmacneal/church_of_the_emperor_as_messiah.git
- Add your changes
- File a pull request.
- That's it!

It uses netcoreapp2.1 (meaning you have to install dotnet-sdk-2.1.300), bootstrap 4. This enables GDPR support (kind of essential these days) and some other goodies down the road.
