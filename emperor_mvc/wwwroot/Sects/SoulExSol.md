# Soul Ex Sol

## Originating Planet : Haqani

## Associated Order : Observers

A sub-sect of the High Church Observers, the Soul ex Sol is the amalgamation of several primal religions, sects and cults built around the worshiping the Sun and other celestial phenomena. They claim that since stars help form and create life, they are the energy force behind the Soul that connect all born of the stars. It has small, but adamant communities all over the sector, especially on among Serfs of House Vela on Haqani. It promotes all of the Ten Virtues, but has special focus on Charity, Wisdom, Justice and Hope.
