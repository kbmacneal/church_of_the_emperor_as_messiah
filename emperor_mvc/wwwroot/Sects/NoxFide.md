# Nox Fide

## Originating Planet : Teuthem

## Associated Order : Purists

A sect of nihilistic night worshipers. Based at the core on the teachings of the High Church Purists, their members revere the night and welcome it as the waiting doom it is for their world. They view stars as bad omens as if any significant break in the spore cloud were to occur and light were to reach the surface in sufficient quantity it would play havoc with the ecosystem upon which they depend and fear.
