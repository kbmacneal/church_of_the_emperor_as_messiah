In the fifth year of his reign, the first Emperor of the Velites, having unfit sleep, awoke with a shout, and, calling his assistants and noble court to him, did relate to them the following tale:

"In my dream I saw a ship, buttressed in gold, floating among the stars. Suddenly the skies around ripped asunder, and from the darkness came the Enemy. Wreathed in darkest fire was his head, and his eyes shone with the light of a thousand novae. Cloaked in darkness was his body. His arms were of obsidian, and his feet of coldest iron. In his hands he carried the powers of Heaven, and around his neck were the the chains of the ten vices. Lifting his great mace, he struck the ship, and it shattered, broken into ten pieces, which were thrown among the stars."

At this the assistants and nobles trembled, but the Emperor continued:

"Each of these ten parts fell flaming onto a planet, and from the wreckage rose ten cities, and from each of these ten cities rose yet more ships, and, flinging themselves into the void, they did battle with the Enemy. But one of these ships, fashioned as a snake and clad in green, turned against its brothers and clashed with them instead. So the proud ships of Humanity fell, and the darkness spread to every star and world.

But from the darkness did emerge the Emperor, clothed in light. Around his neck was the lace of the ten virtues, and on his head was the crown of dominion. In his hand was the hammer of Justice, and his feet were shod in hottest steel. The light of Virtue shone from his eyes, driving the darkness before him as the trees before a hurricane. The Emperor did battle with the Enemy, and he drove him from Acheron Rho, back into the Void, and the Void swallowed him."
