## Is the Emperox God?

This question gets asked a lot, and the answer depends on who you ask and in what context. Since the High Church is a multi-faceted organization, incorporating the beliefs of many different earth religions and cultures, different branches will have different answers.

For example, the Karmists believe that the Emperox is a piece of the divine soul, incarnated into human flesh. The Purists believe that the Emperox is the prime ideal, the perfect human, and in that way becomes "divine". Some others may yet hold to the idea that the Emperox is not technically a god, but is sent on a holy mission to rule humanity.

What all branches hold, in the end, is that the Emperox is "divine" (whatever they mean that to be), that they have the right to rule humanity, and that this right extends from the divine (either the Divine Right of Kings or via the Will of Heaven, read their respective wikipedia articles for more information).

## What is the Church's position towards the other noble houses? The Corporatists? The CHR?

The Church's primary aim in relations with the other faction is to further stabilize the Empire. The Church sees its goal as serving as the anchor. While the other factions decide who will rule, what to do with non-imperial forces etc, the Church focuses on making sure the essential services the Church provides are provided. In so doing, they seek to make sure the Empire doesn't fall into anarchy or civil war.

## Does the Church want to destroy my faction?

No. Really, no. We aim to stabilize the empire, so unless your faction threatens to undermine that stability it is highly unlikely the Church is trying to kill off your faction. Even during the synth war, the Church didn't land troops on Cygnus-held planets. Nothing said IC should be construed to mean that we are "going after" a faction. We express our political ambitions purely through the faction turn and official diplomatic channels.

## Are members of the Church Noble?

That is actually a very difficult question, one that we have not completely sorted out, so this answer may be edited at a later date to better reflect current thinking and rulings. However, here is what we have so far:

Members of the Church are not noble, by definition. The Church is a quasi-political entity outside of the Imperial hierarchy. So, when a Noble joins the Church (or far more commonly, is "exiled" to the Church, or gives one of their children to the Church), they retain their name but not the legal protections and privileges that come with belonging to a noble house. So Herzog Crux Johann Doe becomes High Priest Crux Johann Doe.

Within the Church, there is no legal division between those members who were Nobles and those who weren't. Any member can attain any position, theoretically. However, social circles tend to play out that distinction.

## Are the Inquisitors going around killing/imprisoning people?

No, that's the wrong sense of the word. When we named the Order, we were under the impression that we would have sort of ecclesiastical law enforcement unit, not a gang of guys (and girls, girls can torture too) running around the sector burning people at the stake.

The Inquisition is more like the ecclesiastical FBI. They maintain investigations on threats to the Church, the Emperor, or the spiritual wellbeing of the Sector.
