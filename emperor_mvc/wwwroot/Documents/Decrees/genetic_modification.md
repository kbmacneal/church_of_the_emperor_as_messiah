## It is declared
Hereby the High Church decrees that modification of the human form for the betterment of the Empire is within our teachings and adheres to the ten Virtues, as long as the Guidelines set by the Council are adhered to. To be considered Virtuous:

1. The vessel must be human at its core.

2. The vesselâ€™s mind must be clear so they can defy the thoughts of heresy.

3. The vessel must retain the ability to feel pain, both of the body and the mind.

## Addendum A

The Most Holy Council of Exarchs, in consultation with the High Lector, has determined a clarification was needed to address new concerns about cybernetic enhancements. It is the ruling of the High Church that the above applies not only to the genetic enhancement of a human, but also to the cybernetic enhancement of the same. In the future, additional Addenda may be added to address technological advancements as they arise.
